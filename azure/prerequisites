Task 1: Create an Azure service principal with Azure CLI

Ansible includes a suite of modules for interacting with Azure Resource Manager, 
giving you the tools to easily create and orchestrate infrastructure on the Microsoft Azure Cloud. 
Using the Azure Resource Manager modules requires authenticating with the Azure API. For this we need Azure service principal for authentication.

1. Click Cloud Shell and select Bash.
2. Enter the following command to create service principle
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name ServicePrincipalName

save the output details

3. Now get subscription id by using
az account show

4. Now we must create a directory named .azure in the home directory and a credentials file under it. 
mkdir ~/.azure

nano ~/.azure/credentials

5. Insert the following lines into the credentials file.

[default]

subscription_id=<your-Azure-subscription_id>

client_id=<azure service-principal-appid>

secret=<azure service-principal-password>

tenant=<azure serviceprincipal-tenant>
